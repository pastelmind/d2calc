# d2calc

d2calc is an interpreter for the mini-language used internally by [Diablo 2].

Diablo 2 uses text files containing [tab-separated values] to store game data.
These text files contain many formulae that control how various skills operate.
The syntax of the formulae is similar to the C language, with a few extensions.
